# Sempervirens -- minimally invasive usage tracking for open source software sustainability

- What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.

Open source software is at the core of modern data-driven scientific research.
Large-scale projects such as LHC and LIGO rely heavily on the work of the open
source software community [].

Open-source software is also used in numerous smaller projects. We know this
because we conduct this research ourselves. We also know this because the
research is ubdoubtedly downloaded and installed; numerous users provide
feedback through communication channels such as mailing lists. Finally, the
software is cited in scientific publications. But none of these channels
provides us with reliable information about the true magnitude of use of the
software. Download statistics are notoriously unreliable [citation needed],
reports to mailing lists provide anecdotal and imprecise evidence of its
utility, and citations are also limited as a mechanism for reporting the
impact of (or any research, for that matter). Furthermore, these signals do
not provide information about the specific patterns of use: where the software
is used, within what computational context (e.g., the operating system and the
hardware that is used). We also cannot tell what parts of the software are
used, and what parts never get used.

This is an impdediment to the sustainability of the software for several reasons: first of all, it prevents the developers of the software from assessing. It also prevents a realistic assessment of the parts of the software that are popular and therefore

We propose here to create a system that would create the necessary data to answer these questions. The system

But tracking the actual usage of software is a hard

- How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
- What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
- Who cares? If you're successful, what difference will it make?
- What are the risks and the payoffs?
- How much will it cost? How long will it take?
- What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?


A few important use-cases:

- Provide funders and other steakholders with statistics regarding

For example, Psychopy, a software project focuse on visual stimulus
[@peirce2007psychopy], uses telemetry to report on the consistent increase in
the usage of the software.

At this point, we are asking to fund the work of

Budget items:
- research, project management, writing the high-level principles,
managing the decision-making process, gathering consensus on our
policies and procedures, writing HOWTOs and managing end-user-focused
writing, and potentially a bit of travel: Changeset Consulting, probably
more than 150 hours, about $20K is probably a good guess (can give you a
more detailed estimate regarding individual line items if you'd like)

- developing website describing the project, including some graphical
design: a webdev/communications subcontractor, maybe $30K?

- doing legal research and writing policies: a legal team, some of whom
will need to be paid: $120K


Total of about $170K [split it up, to make funding easier? What's first?]

The rough schedule would be:

Phase I: [How long?] Changeset does research, moves the
NumFOCUS formalization along, sets up convenings at PyCon and SciPy,
builds the legal team and gets relevant stakeholders onto the
sempervirens-discuss mailing list, and gets advice to answer the questions:
* what countries' privacy laws apply here?
* what level of ongoing social and technical maintenance should we build
capacity for?

The set of deliverables would be:
* NumFOCUS relationship formalized or clearly about to be formalized
* legal team in place
* nation-level and future project resourcing scope tightened
* clear path forward for the consensus process & community approval
* technical roadmap that NumFOCUS, Jupyter & NumPy team find feasible

Cost: maybe $40K, combining some Changeset costs & some legal costs

Phase II: [how long?]: Changeset works with webdev subcontractor, legal team,
and the Juputer & NumPy teams to deliver the First Light milestone (per
Nathaniel's deliverable outline reproduced below [??]).

Cost: ~$80K
